NOTE: The Selenium project is configured to run on localhost port whatever Kate has. 
You will need to change the port to whatever you have for it to work.


* Since all our localhost port is 8084
We can run the selenium test case on the same port without the need to changing/modifying the port
* To run the selenium test cases:
1. Install node (version 8 or 10)
2. npm install -g selenium-side-runner
3. install web drivers:
    3.1: npm install -g chromedriver
    3.2: npm install -g edgedriver
    3.3: npm install -g geckodriver
    3.4: npm install -g iedriver
4. All the web drivers should be located in users/syntel/AppData/Roaming/npm/node_modules,
make sure to add each of the drivers to your PATH
5. run selenium test case (this will run the tests base on your default browser):
    5.1: selenium-side-runner /path/to/your-project.side 
6. You can also specify certain browser to run
    6.1: selenium-side-runner -c "browserName=firefox" /path/to/your-project.side
    6.2: selenium-side-runner -c "browserName=chrome" /path/to/your-project.side
    6.3: selenium-side-runner -c "browserName=edge" /path/to/your-project.side
    6.4: selenium-side-runner -c "browserName='internet explorer" /path/to/your-project.side
* internet explorer and edge didn't work for me yet.
